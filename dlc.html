                        <p> Hidden Dreams is the first of the four free content packs for Hollow Knight. It was announced on June 7th, 2017 and released on August 3rd, 2017. </p>
                        <p> This update added two new boss fights with varying difficult levels, beating one of these bosses once will unlock the next difficulty level and so on. The last difficulty levels of these bosses are considered very difficult and a challenge only met by the most dedicated of players. It also brought the first major quality of life changes to the game including a new Stag Station which is used for fast travel around the kingdom of Hallownest and a new fast travel mechanic, which lets you set travel points that you can freely travel to at any time. </p>

                        <p> The Grimm Troupe is the second of the four free content packs for Hollow Knight. Its name and content were revealed on September 14th, 2017. It was released on October 26th, 2017. </p>
                        <p> In this expansion, the Knight can light a "Nightmare Lantern" found hidden in the Howling Cliffs after dream nailing a dead bug with a strange mask, after which a mysterious group of circus performers known as the Grimm Troupe arrives in Dirtmouth. Their leader, Troupe Master Grimm, gives the Knight a quest to collect magic flames throughout Hallownest in order to take part in a "twisted ritual". He gives the player the Grimmchild charm, which absorbs the flames into itself, progressing the ritual, and, when it is upgraded, attacks enemies.</p>

                        <p> Lifeblood is a major update to Hollow Knight originally planned for the release of the game on Nintendo Switch. It was pushed to beta testing on March 23rd, 2018, with its name and content revealed on the 24th. Lifeblood was then released on April 20th, 2018, and thus became the third of the four free content packs for Hollow Knight. </p>
                        <p> The lifeblood expansion enhanced many technical and visual aspects of the game and balanced the gameplay. Lifeblood also added a new boss fight, which can be fought in the hive, a subarea inhabited by different kinds of bees that attack the player on sight. Lifeblood also added lifeblood, which the update was named after. Lifeblood grants the player extra masks temporarily. Upon taking damage, the knight loses lifeblood masks, which cannot be regained. </p>

                        <p> Godmaster is the last of the four free content packs for Hollow Knight. It was initially revealed as Gods & Glory along with its content on January 31st, 2018, but renamed to Godmaster on August 15th, 2018 due to a trademark conflict with the mobile game Gods and Glory published by Wargaming. It was released on August 23rd, 2018. </p>
                        <p> The main hub of the expansion is known as Godhome, and is accessed by using the Dreamnail on a new NPC called the Godseeker. There are five "pantheons", each being a "boss rush", containing a set of bosses that must all be defeated without dying. The final pantheon, the Pantheon of Hallownest, contains every boss in the game. </p>
