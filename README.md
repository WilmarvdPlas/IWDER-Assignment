# IWDER-Assignment
Project for assignment of the IWDER module from my first year at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden. The assignment was to build a simple responsive website with base JavaScript, semantic HTML and CSS. Besides that the website also had to contain a basic simulation of a webshop. 

I was free to choose any game/movie franchise of my liking as the topic for the website. Back when I was working on this project I had just picked up Hollow Knight, one of my favorite games to date. So I decided to use Hollow Knight as the topic of this project and tried to make the website as Hollow Knight themed as I could. I feel like I succeeded in my attempt to do so. In the end I recieved an 89/100 score for this project which I was extremely pleased with considering the amount of effort I had put into it.

## Deployment
Part of the assignment was to deploy the website using firebase. You can check it out here:
